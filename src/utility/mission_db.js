This can put the crew or passengers at risk of drowning or exposure to the elements. In such cases, a search and rescue team may be deployed to locate the capsized boat and assist in the rescue of any individuals who may be stranded or in distress. The mission may involve a coordinated effort between rescue divers, boats, and aircraft to locate and rescue any survivors or recover any casualties. The deployment of a search and rescue team in this situation can be crucial in saving lives and preventing further harm.",
